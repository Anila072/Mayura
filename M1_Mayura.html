Oh how could I know so long ago what happened<br>
All I could do was try to break the pattern<br>
But you wouldn't see all of the love you shattered<br>
What it all meant to me, it didn't seem to matter<br>

Now I watch this world in color<br>
Hoping that I can recover<br>
From your words that had no honor<br>
Cuz your heart can't spare a dollar<br>

Only nightmares lurk in the night<br>
But this bad dream won't leave my sight<br>
I just need an antidote but I can't emote what I'm thinking<br>
I just need a remedy but I can not see what I'm fighting<br>

And some folks say that I should be winning<br>
And some folks say that I'll be ok<br>
But there's one person that I'm wishing<br>
That would give me the time of day<br>

It's never gonna happen<br>
It's never gonna happen<br>
It's never gonna happen<br>
It's never gonna happen<br>
No way<br>

Now I'm wondering why you ain't calling<br>
While I'm waiting here by the phone<br>
Now every second my heart is falling<br>
Well I guess this ain't what I thought it was<br>
No I guess this ain't what I thought it was<br>

I guess this ain't what I thought it<br>
Oh I guess this ain't what I thought it was<br>
I guess this ain't what I thought it<br>
Oh I guess this ain't what I thought it was<br>
I guess this ain't what I thought it<br>
Oh I guess this ain't what I thought it was<br>
I guess this ain't what I thought it<br>
Oh I guess this ain't what I thought it was<br>

Somehow you can keep on living<br>
And forget all that I've given<br>
It don't matter how I try cuz I'll always side from your vision<br>
And now I only pass the time hoping I'm the one that you're missin'<br>

And some folks say that I should be winning<br>
And some folks say that I'll be ok<br>
But there's one person that I'm wishing<br>
That would give me the time of day<br>

It's never gonna happen<br>
It's never gonna happen<br>
It's never gonna happen<br>
It's never gonna happen<br>
No way<br>

Now I'm wondering why you ain't calling<br>
While I'm waiting here by the phone<br>
Now every second my heart is falling<br>
Well I guess this ain't what I thought it was<br>

Now I'm wondering why you ain't calling<br>
While I'm waiting here by the phone<br>
Now every second my heart is falling<br>
Well I guess this ain't what I thought it was<br>
No I guess this ain't what I thought it was<br>

I guess this ain't what I thought it<br>
Oh I guess this ain't what I thought it was<br>
I guess this ain't what I thought it<br>
Oh I guess this ain't what I thought it was<br>
I guess this ain't what I thought it<br>
Oh I guess this ain't what I thought it was<br>
I guess this ain't what I thought it<br>
Oh I guess this ain't what I thought it was<br>
